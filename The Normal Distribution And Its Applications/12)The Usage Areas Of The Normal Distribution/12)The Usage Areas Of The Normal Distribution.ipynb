    "-In social sciences, it is used to model the distribution of all kinds of variables such as height, IQ scores, SAT scores and job satisfaction. In addition, it enables us to determine the relative difficulty of test questions, problems and other test items, and seperate a given group into subgroups according to capacity in psychological researchers. As a consequence, the normal distribution helps us to use inferential statistics to compare different groups and make estimates about populations by using samples. It can be followed by natural and social phenomena."

    "-In finance, it is used in quality control and sales forecasting. It is very effective and significant for companies to use statistical process control techniques and historical sales data. As a result, it is very assistant for them to monitor the quality of their products and estimate future sales. In addition, it helps companies to model the behaviours of customers and evaluate the performances of employees by comparing other customers and other employees, respectively. As a consequence, this plays an important role on companies to optimize their strategies of marketing, sales and the enhancement of performance. It is influential for business analysis and decision making by using the normal distribution."

The hypothesis tests enable us to to test the claims of normally distributed items. Also, it is assistant for us to calculate confidence intervals for parameters and critical regions for hypothesis tests."

    "-Thanks to the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is useful when we examine the returns of the individual stock because the analysis is simple due to the relative ease of generating the necessary financial data. As a result, the investors of all types rely on the theorem to analyze stock returns, construct portfolios, and manage risk. For instance, the investor wants to analyze the overall return for the stock index that comprises 900 equities. In this case, the investor can simply and easily study the sample of stocks to cultivate the estimated returns of the total index. To be safe, at least 30 randomly selected stocks across various sectors can be sampled for the theorem to hold. In addition, the last selected stocks should be swapped out with different names to help eliminate bias."

Furthermore, it is assistant for us to facilitate the computation of probabilities, confidence intervals, and other statistical measures thanks to the symmetric bell shape of it. Then, it enables the application of statistical tests, which assume normality and facilitate to understand the distribution of data, and helps to make statistical inferences about the population from the sample thanks to standard statistical tests such as t-tests and Empirical Rule, respectively."

That is, the aim of it is to enable standardization of datasets from different populations for comparative analysis. It can be done by transforming data to the standard normal distribution, whose mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1, by using z-scores. Then, it aims to ease the calculation of probabilities and critical values by using the standard normal distribution tables."
